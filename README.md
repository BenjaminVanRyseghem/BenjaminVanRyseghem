### Benjamin Van Ryseghem

I am a senior software engineer with a taste for OOP and FP :smile:
I developed a love for Javascript over the years (and the ES releases),
but I enjoy Clojure for spare projects.

On my free time, beside coding, I like carpentry, 3d printing and miniatures painting.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on

- [numbro](https://github.com/BenjaminVanRyseghem/numbro) is my main project in term of visibility.
- [zen-forms](https://github.com/BenjaminVanRyseghem/zen-forms/) is a cool side project, go have a look :smile:
